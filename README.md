In this project, I fine-tuned two BERT-based models for extractive question answering, specifically focusing on the NewsQA and CoQA datasets. Both datasets are designed for extracting answers from a given context, but they required different preprocessing techniques due to variations in data structure and context types. Additionally, the evaluation techniques had to be customized to suit each dataset's format, as the NewsQA and CoQA datasets have distinct approaches to presenting questions and answers.
