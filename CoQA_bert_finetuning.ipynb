    "We will fine-tune a BERT model on the CoQA dataset, which consists of conversational questions posed by crowdworkers based on a diverse set of stories. Unlike traditional question-answering datasets, answers in CoQA are not always direct spans from the text. Sometimes, they are more interpretive or require reasoning, such as responding with \"the garrison first\" when the text only mentions \"the garrison.\" Therefore, we need to be careful when evaluating the model, as it must handle these nuances and provide accurate answers even when they are not explicit text spans.\n",

      "The morning of that Wednesday of Corpus Christi, fateful to all concerned in this chronicle, dawned misty and grey, and the air was chilled by the wind that blew from the sea. The chapel bell tinkled out its summons, and the garrison trooped faithfully to Mass. \n",
      "\n",
      "Presently came Monna Valentina, followed by her ladies, her pages, and lastly, Peppe, wearing under his thin mask of piety an air of eager anxiety and unrest. Valentina was very pale, and round her eyes there were dark circles that told of sleeplessness, and as she bowed her head in prayer, her ladies observed that tears were falling on the illuminated Mass-book over which she bent. And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass commenced. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were absent only from the gathering Gonzaga and Fortemani, besides a sentry and the three prisoners. Francesco and his two followers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gonzaga had presented himself to Valentina with the plausible tale that, as the events of which Fanfulla's letter had given them knowledge might lead Gian Maria at any moment to desperate measures, it might be well that he should reinforce the single man-at-arms patrolling the walls. Valentina, little recking now whether the castle held or fell, and still less such trifles as Gonzaga's attendance at Mass, had assented without heeding the import of what he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "And so, his face drawn and his body quivering with the excitement of what he was about to do, Gonzaga had repaired to the ramparts so soon as he had seen them all safely into chapel. The sentinel was that same clerkly youth Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen. If a man there was among the soldiery at Roccaleone with whom he deemed that he had an account to settle, that man was Aventano. \n",

      "Context:  When we talk about red packets, the most important question is \"What are you going to do with it?\" One thing you could do is to put your money in the bank. Maybe you don't know, some students in Hubei began to use the Xiaogui Dangjia bank card this year. This is a card for children. It is from China Minsheng Bank in Wuhan. Wang Ming is a 14-year-old junior student in Wuhan. He said \"All my pocket money has a place to go now. I can pay my own school fees .\" Zhu Yu, a manager of Minsheng Bank, said that they knew lots of students who didn't know how to use their money. So they wanted them to know how to use it carefully. Parents worry that children don't know how to take care of the money by themselves. Shen qiangqiang's mother like the card very much. Shen was asking his mother for a computer for a long time, but his mother didn't buy it for him. She said, \"We want him to use his card to save money for the computer. If we buy everything he asks for, he will think money comes too easily, and he won't work hard for it.\" Today, there are many different kinds of bank cards. They are from different banks. People put their money in them. Then they can use their money at any time. People can do many things with bank cards. They can wash cars, go shopping, eat delicious food and travel to other places with the money in their bank cards. The most important thing is not \"How much did you get?\" It is necessary for everyone to learn how to save your money and use your money correctly.\n",

[SEP] The Vatican Apostolic Library ( ), more commonly called the Vatican Library or simply the Vat, is the library of the Holy See, located in Vatican City. Formally established in 1475, although it is much older, it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. It has 75, 000 codices from throughout history, as well as 1. 1 million printed books, which include some 8, 500 incunabula. The Vatican Library is a research library for history, law, philosophy, science and theology. The Vatican Library is open to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs. Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 can be requested in person or by mail. In March 2014, the Vatican Library began an initial four - year project of digitising its collection of manuscripts, to be made available online. The Vatican Secret Archives were separated from the library at the beginning of the 17th century ; they contain another 150, 000 items. Scholars have traditionally divided the history of the library into five periods, Pre - Lateran, Lateran, Avignon, Pre - Vatican and Vatican. The Pre - Lateran period, comprising the initial days of the library, dated from the earliest days of the Church. Only a handful of volumes survive from this period, though some are very significant.

    "In our example, the predicted answer is \"in a barn near a farmhouse,\" while the expected answer is \"in a barn.\" Although these answers are generally the same in meaning, the 'exact_match' score is 0. This demonstrates that the 'exact match' metric may not always provide an accurate evaluation of the model's performance, and therefore, it shouldn't be solely relied upon as a true indicator of performance.\n",

       "['Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer\\'s horses slept. But Cotton wasn\\'t alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton\\'s mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer\\'s orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \\n\\n\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\" \\n\\n\"I only wanted to be more like you\". \\n\\nCotton\\'s mommy rubbed her face on Cotton\\'s and said \"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, Cotton\\'s mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton\\'s fur was all all dry. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn\\'t want that!\" \\n\\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind. I like being special\".']"
