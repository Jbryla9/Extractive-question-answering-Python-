       "'(CNN) -- Jewish organizations called for a Romanian official to resign and face a criminal investigation after he wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRadu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRadu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, and his 15-year-old son \"entered the stage marching the clearly identifiable Nazi \\'goose step,\\'\" the Center for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism in Romania said in a letter to the country\\'s prosecutor general.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe organization\\'s director, Marco Katz, said Mazare had broken Romanian law and encouraged his son to do the same, \"educating him to treat the law with contempt.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKatz said Mazare was sending a message \"that to wear Nazi uniforms and to march the Nazi steps is legal and \\'in vogue\\' in Romania.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe urged the authorities and the head of Mazare\\'s Social Democrat party to show that message \"will be strongly countermanded.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMazare, 41, said he had not noticed the Nazi swastika symbol on the uniform before he wore it, according to the Romanian Times newspaper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn\\'t see it,\" he said. \"I really liked the look of the uniform after seeing it in the Tom Cruise film \\'Valkyrie.\\' I bought it from a costume hire shop in Germany.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA top Nazi hunter said Mazare should quit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The proper thing for you to do is to admit your mistake, apologize for it and resign your position,\" Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem wrote to Mazare. Zuroff sent CNN a copy of the letter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said it was no defense that the uniform was that of the Wehrmacht -- the army -- rather than the SS, the elite Nazi guard which took the lead in killing Jews during the Holocaust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Wehrmacht played an active role in the mass murder of European Jewry and many other innocent victims. By dressing in a Wehrmacht uniform, you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide,\" the letter said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It would hard to adequately describe the depth of the pain that your appearance caused, not only to Jews and other victims of Nazism, but to any person of moral integrity who knows the history of World War II,\" Zuroff wrote.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZuroff told CNN he did not expect Mazare to resign, or even to respond to the letter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he said he hoped the mayor might act on Zuroff\\'s suggestion that Mazare create a Romanian-language edition of an acclaimed exhibition on the crimes of the Wehrmacht.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Nazi uniform incident, which took place Sunday, was the first time Zuroff heard of Mazare, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He has a history of being outrageous, but his antics have never included something that I would deal with,\" Zuroff said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s a real character, apparently. He\\'s also very popular, which makes this much more difficult.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCNN attempts to contact Mazare were unsuccessful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRomania was a Nazi ally from 1940 to 1944, under the leadership of a right-wing military government led by General Ion Antonescu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt least 270,000 Romanian Jews were killed or died from mistreatment during the Holocaust, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 1930 Romanian census recorded 728,115 people who identified themselves as Jewish, comprising approximately 4 percent of the population, the reference work says.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAntonescu was deposed in 1944 and Romania switched sides in World War II.'"

    "As we can see, our example has been split into seven inputs, each containing the question and some part of the context. Note that the answer to the question (“the killing of a teen”) only appears in the first input. By dealing with long contexts in this way, we will create some training examples where the answer is not included in the context. For those examples, the labels will be start_position = end_position = 0 (so we predict the [CLS] token). We will also set these labels in the unfortunate case where the answer has been truncated, meaning we only have the start or end of it. For the examples where the answer is fully in the context, the labels will be the index of the token where the answer starts and the index of the token where the answer ends.\n",

The figure of 35,000 refers to NATO troops. Therefore, we can conclude that the model's performance is likely somewhat better than we initially estimated."

The Pentagon is planning to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere have been indications that Obama soon could be asked to commit even more American troops. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000-troop increase before considering whether to send more.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport in the United States for the war in Afghanistan has dipped to an all-time low. Just 39 percent of Americans favor the war, while 58 percent oppose it, according to a national CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecent polling suggests that the increasing violence and slow pace of progress are also taking a toll on support for the war in Canada.\\n\\n\\n\\nObama thanked Harper for his country\\'s commitment to Afghanistan, where more than 2,800 Canadian troops and dozens of civilians are stationed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They have fought; they have had staying power; they have absorbed losses that we all grieve for,\" he said.  Watch Obama and Harper meet »\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the Canadian forces are based in the southern Kandahar province, home to some of the worst violence and instability. At least 130 Canadian troops have been killed in the war.\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year, after a national debate, the Canadian government extended the mission -- which was to end this February -- until the end of 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\nHarper said Wednesday that \"Canada is not leaving Afghanistan\" but is \"transitioning from a predominately military mission to a mission that will be a civilian humanitarian mission after 2011.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two leaders also discussed economic issues, issuing a joint statement after their meeting saying in part that \"open trade and investment are essential for competitiveness and sustainable growth in North America and globally.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nObama acknowledged that the \"Buy American\" clause in the economic stimulus package has been a \"source of irritation\" between Canada and the United States and is something Harper has repeatedly brought to his attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe clause is a provision in the $787 billion stimulus package enacted in February that states only American goods can be used in stimulus projects. But it stipulates that the measure would not override existing U.S. trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nHarper said Canada\\'s concerns about the clause are \"important irritants ... but relatively small\" when compared with the overall U.S.-Canadian trade relationship.']\n",

After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).[5][6] Paris 2024 marked the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
